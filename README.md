# fs_p4_corpus
 
This project is an English language corpus based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov novel.
For server I used Node.js, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB database. Also there is one file in Python for text analysis.
For client I used React on JavaScript.


Currently you can start the project by dowloading it to your computer and opening it in a code editor program, as Visual Studio Code.

How to start the app:
First go to server folder and run "nodemon server.js". This will start server on port 3001.
Second go to client folder and run "npm start". This should open the app on port 3000 in you Google Chrome browser.


Special thanks to The Project Gutenberg eBook. Your guys are awesome.
